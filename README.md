Advanced C Programming Language: 2nd Year [Semester 3] Series 1 (Function (function design), Array (dynamic with malloc), Record) 
Series 1
Plan
Exercise 1: Functions (function design)

Exercise 2: Arrays (dynamic function malloc)

Exercise 3: Records

The objective of this series is to explore dynamic data structures, particularly singly and doubly linked lists, as well as trees and graphs. We will also cover a chapter on static structures, specifically files.

To achieve this objective, it is essential to master certain prerequisites, namely:

Functions, particularly the 'malloc' function

Pointers

Records

The principle of recursion

Exercise 1: Objective: Function Design
Write a C program that calculates and displays the sum of two integers.

Organize the processing in the form of a function.

Write a C program that determines and displays the minimum of two integers.

Structure the processing in the form of a function.

Exercise 2: Objective: Take the first step towards solving the problem of static memory management when using arrays (for example, int tab [100]) by using the malloc function.
Write a program to input and display the elements of an array named tab, where the number of elements is specified by the user.

What do you observe when the user enters the number of elements?

What solutions do you propose?

Exercise 3: Objective: Manipulate records (structs in C) keywords: typedef, recursion, pointers, etc.
Define a record named product with the following fields: quantity (qte) of type int and price of type float.

Calculate the total price including tax (TTC) of a product x?

Same question as question 2, but this time, the product x is a pointer.

Structure the program in the form of functions if possible?

Is it possible to integrate the functions that manipulate the record product x within the declaration of the product record?
